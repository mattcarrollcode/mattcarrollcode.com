I've recently started as a developer advocate working on React. React has a lot of users and I want my experience ramping up on React to reflect how people actually use React. I want to understand what React developers go through. Many developers learn React to get a job or start a business. So I want to build something that could be a small business or startup. I hope this will help focus what I’m building on something pragmatic.

I’ve decided to try building a travel planning app I’m going to call Journey because, ChatGPT:

Along the way, I want to use some of React's cutting-edge features. Front-end frameworks have evolved to include how clients work with servers. Coupling the server and client has led to better developer and user experiences. The React team has been a prominent force in this shift with React Server Components. I'm going to be trying out React server components with [Next.js 13’s app directory](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/app-directory-roadmap). I want to try this new paradigm out. 

I’ve often observed a chasm between a real app and documentation. Documentation that shows you how to compose multiple concepts is rare. This (what you’re reading now) is the beginning of my attempt to fix this ramp from getting started to an intermediate project. The only thing that is missing to bridge the gap between getting started and a real app is to:

a) build a non-trivial project and 

b) write down the silly things you did, how you fixed them, and what you’d do differently

Along this journey (ah, ok pun time) I expect to make a ridiculous amount of mistakes. I’ve undoubtedly made dozens just in this post and how I'm thinking about this project now. I will document them all here, along with my fixes, and what I would do differently if I was starting fresh.
