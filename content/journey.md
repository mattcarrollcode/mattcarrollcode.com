# Journey
*Published Febuary 4th, 2023*

Hi, I’m Matt. 

I’ve worked as a developer advocate for Google Assistant, Fuchsia, YouTube, Evernote, and Google Cloud AI. My latest gig is as a developer advocate for React. 

The old joke is that there is a new front-end framework created every few minutes. 2022 seems to have evolved from frameworks to how front-end frameworks work with backends. Now, there aren’t just new frameworks but different takes on using servers and clients to create the best developer and user experiences we’ve seen in a long time.

The React team has been a large force in this shift with React Server Components. Currently, the only game in town when it comes to playing around with React server components is Next.js 13’s app directory. I want to try this new paradigm out. 

React has a lot of users and I want what I build to reflect what people want to do. I find I’m better able to advocate for React developers if I actually go through what they have to go through. It seems to me that many developers learn React to get a job or start a business. So I want to build something that could reasonably be a small business or startup to focus what I’m building on something pragmatic that reflects the journey many developers have learning React. Later on, I want to explore writing apps with React Native so the idea needs to be able to grow into a meaningful app as well.

I’ve decided to try building a travel planning app I’m going to call Journey because ChatGPT:

In working across a variety of developer platforms I’ve found there is often a chasm between getting started guides and API documentation. Often good developer platforms and tools focus on the getting started experience and documenting features but it's rare to see a platform help devs smoothly transition from getting started to intermediate projects that compose multiple concepts.

This (what you’re reading now) is my attempt to fix this ramp from getting started to an intermediate project. The only thing that is missing to bridge the getting started to the intermediate gap is to a) build a non-trivial project and b) write down the stupid things you did, how you fixed them, and what you’d do differently.

Along this journey (ah, ok pun time) I expect to make a ridiculous amount of mistakes (I’ve undoubtedly made dozens just in this post and setup). I will document them all here, along with my fixes, and what I would do differently if I was starting fresh. If that sounds like something interesting to you, you can sign up here to get an email when I post something new.
