title: React - the people

I left Google to learn about frontend development. Up to that point my career would be best characterized as a series of backend developer experience positions. I had no idea the kind of community I’d be joining or the quality of the people that I would be working with.

I joined Meta to work on React last year (2022) in October. It was nerve wracking. It was apparent that Meta’s first round of layoffs would happen in November. I was reporting to a central developer relations team, but I would be focusing on React. I very quickly found myself more at home on the React team than the team I reported to. Part of that was because I worked more closely with the React team than my own team, but most of the feeling of belonging was because of the React team’s incredible open, genuine, and collaborative approach.

The React team appreciates their unique position, the community, and open source more than any other team I’ve come across. This manifests itself in a humility, work ethic, and openness that is second to none. Having never worked on a serious frontend project before, I had a lot of work to do to ramp up. But the team was very open to hearing about my developer relations experience with other products and very quickly trusted me with large broadly sweeping projects.

A few months in, I was feeling very much at home on the React team and had a very clear set of projects and goals. I wasn’t comfortable just yet, but I was well on my way. The next few months were a fun grind on hard but rewarding projects, and I was able to see the first signs of progress before I was hit by the second round of layoffs.

On the day of the layoffs, I woke up early, and checked my email to find I was among those laid off at Meta. I would later find out that a large majority of the developer relations team at Meta was laid off alongside myself. Before I really had the opportunity to emotionally process what had happened I was inundated with messages from the React team. Everyone who I had worked with and some I hadn’t even met yet laid on messages, introductions, and public messages to help me.

[Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) used his considerable reputation and put his standing at Meta at risk to tell Meta’s leadership the role I had played on the React team. [Eli White](https://twitter.com/Eli_White) worked behind the scenes to introduce me to so many folks and the help I received didn’t stop at Meta. Many folks from the React team from a variety of companies made introductions, asked around, and gave references for me.

While I knew from my short time working on the React team that I had stumbled onto something special, I hadn’t realized the real magic behind that team that had been staring at me the entire time: the people. I’ve seen speculation on what makes React special. I’ve often heard answers like technology, open source, and the industry, and many answers have some merit to them. But my answer to this question is very clear: the people.

Amazingly, [Eli](https://twitter.com/Eli_White) (with help from [Dan](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) and [Seth](https://twitter.com/sethwebster)) managed to hire me back. Over the course of months, Eli worked through multiple levels of approvals and bureaucracy to give me the opportunity to rejoin the team. I’m now back as a developer advocate at Meta reporting directly to the React team.

I started writing this post before the happy ending, and I would have published it whether or not I returned to Meta. The people working on React care about their work in a way I haven’t seen thus far in my career. I’m very happy to be back and I’m excited to jump back into the wild world of React!
